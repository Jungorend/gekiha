# Gekiha

Webserver which hosts an implementation of the [Exceed Fighting System](https://www.level99games.com/collections/exceed-fighting-system)
This is not officially supported by Level99, and instead just a project to see how much I can develop.

## Goals
- Registration/logging system.
- Lobby for multiple games.
- Season 3 cast to choose from.
- Rules enforcement to reduce surface area for mistakes and/or cheating.

## Usage

Still under development, no functionality yet.
