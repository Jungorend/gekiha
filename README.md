# exceed

Just seeing how much of the Exceed engine I can implement.
And relearn Clojure while I'm at it.

## Usage

Right now there's no functionality. Movement on the board has been implemented
but there's no cards or game state yet.

## License

This is a private repository and no license has been set for it yet.
