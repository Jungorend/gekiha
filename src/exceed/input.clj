  "This function is the interface between the game logic and making changes.
  It allows mid-any stage more information to be requests from specific players.
  Active player is the player to request input from.
  type is what sort of request is being made.
  bounds is any restrictions on the request, for example minimum/max values.
  For now it's just a dummy function."
